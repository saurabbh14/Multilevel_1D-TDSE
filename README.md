# Multi-level 1D TDSE solver
There are several techniques to solve the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE). Here, we have a one-dimensional TDSE solver employing the split-operator method, one of the efficient spectral methods. The split-operator method is made efficient due to the accessibility of the fast Fourier transform algorithms. In this package, we use Fast Fourier Transform in the west (FFTW3) package. Below, we discuss the general installation and capabilities of our package.
 
## Installation
### System requirements and dependencies
This package has only been tested on Linux systems (Ubuntu/Debian). The distribution for Mac and Windows is being worked on.

1. Nix package manager
2. git (optional)

### Installing Nix
To install Nix, follow the instructions on the [Nix download](https://nixos.org/download/) page.

**Note:** The Multi-user installation (assuming you have root access) is recommended; however, the single-user installation should work too!

After successfully installing Nix, add the following line to the file /etc/nix/nix.conf.
```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

### Bulding package
After installing Nix, just clone this [github repo](https://github.com/saurabbh14/Multilevel_1D-TDSE.git) to the intended directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/saurabbh14/Multilevel_1D-TDSE.git 
```
Or you can simply download the [ZIP file of the repo](https://github.com/saurabbh14/Multilevel_1D-TDSE/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it in the intended directory.

Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or unzipped the git repo.
```
$ cd $Dir_path
```

Once in the directory, just run the following command
```
$ nix build
```

This will create an executable file at $Dir_path/result/bin/ML-TDSE.

### Test run
To run the test calculations, you can use the provided input file for the H2+ molecular ion.
```
./results/bin/ML-TDSE input.ini
```  

For more in depth documentation of the package is given in [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](./DOCUMENTATION.md) file and for some usage examples are listed in [`USAGE.md`](./USAGE.md) file.
